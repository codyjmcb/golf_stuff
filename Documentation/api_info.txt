    Double quotes denote string literals ... Ex. "Hello World" denotes the string literal Hello World.
    Curly Brackets are used to denote database objects as they exist, usually precursed by a describing keyword ... Ex. "... returns all rows in the table{first_table}" in this example,
        table denotes the object type, and {first_table} is used to show the name of the table is "first_table"
